database system that efficiently stores and manages user profiles,connections, job postings, and other relevant information. You are required
to perform the following tasks:
ER Diagram:

relationships between entities in the LinkedIn database.
• Include entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities in the ER
diagram.

LinkedIn database.
Database System:
• Create a new database with your RegNo

such as users, profiles, connections, job postings, and any other
relevant entities you deem necessary.

types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
• Implement the necessary integrity constraints, such as unique
constraints, not-null constraints, and any other constraints deemed
necessary for data consistency.
• Populate the tables with sample data to demonstrate the
functionality of the LinkedIn database.

o Retrieve a user's profile information, including their
connections and job history.

location, industry).
o Insert new user profiles, job postings, and connection requests
into the respective tables.

delete the data accurately.
